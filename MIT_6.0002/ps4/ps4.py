    Runs simulations and plots graphs for problem 4.

    For each of num_trials trials:
        * instantiate a list of ResistantBacteria
        * instantiate a patient
        * run a simulation for 150 timesteps, add the antibiotic, and run the
          simulation for an additional 250 timesteps, recording the total
          bacteria population and the resistance bacteria population after
          each time step

    Plot the average bacteria population size for both the total bacteria
    population and the antibiotic-resistant bacteria population (y-axis) as a
    function of elapsed time steps (x-axis) on the same plot. You might find
    the helper function make_two_curve_plot helpful

    Args:
        num_bacteria (int): number of ResistantBacteria to create for
            the patient
        max_pop (int): maximum bacteria population for patient
        birth_prob (float int [0-1]): reproduction probability
        death_prob (float in [0, 1]): probability of a bacteria cell dying
        resistant (bool): whether the bacteria initially have
            antibiotic resistance
        mut_prob (float in [0, 1]): mutation probability for the
            ResistantBacteria cells
        num_trials (int): number of simulation runs to execute

    Returns: a tuple of two lists of lists, or two 2D arrays
        populations (list of lists or 2D array): the total number of bacteria
            at each time step for each trial; total_population[i][j] is the
            total population for trial i at time step j
        resistant_pop (list of lists or 2D array): the total number of
            resistant bacteria at each time step for each trial;
            resistant_pop[i][j] is the number of resistant bacteria for
            trial i at time step j
