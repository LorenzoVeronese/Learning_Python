# Python-Excercises
These are solutions of some of the excercises of the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart (2nd Edition). 
  You can find the book at the following link: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc
I'm learning Python using this book, so the solution of every chapter's excercise is created using only previous concepts contained in it. 
  The first number of the file indicates the chapter, the second part indicates the title of the excercise.
Report me the errors and, if a more expert guy should come across this contents, I would be happy to see smarter and simple solutions!
  Hope this material will be usefull to all who, as me, are learning Python.
